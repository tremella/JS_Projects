There are four relevant files to the app.

    The HTML file, which has the buttons, imports the stylesheet, and draws the circle.
    timer.js, where the Timer class is defined
    index.js, where the timer instance is called, along with the callback functions to handle visuals
    style.css, which he gave us and we didn't study.
**********************************
The important things in HTML:
> fontawesome accessible via
    <link
         rel="stylesheet"
         href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.11.2/css/all.min.css"
       />
> icons accessible via 
    <button id="start"><i class="fas fa-play"></i></button>
**********************************
the important things in timer.js: 

> the constructor function ensures that the
basic elements (buttons, time input) exist when the instance is made. 

> the callbacks are also created because we want to pass in the visual functionality
of the border ticking down. All the callbacks are called "onStart"/"onComplete" etc

> the reason the visual functionality was passed in
via the instance and not defined in the class, was because it's kind of a
different and not-totally-necessary process. Keeping it out of the class
definition keeps the code readable.
**********************************
the important things  in index.js
>this is where we invoke the INSTANCE of the Timer class. 
> we pass in the buttons into the constructor, plus the optional callbacks to handle the animation

> this is where we import the duration field, and the buttons, using document.querySelector
> we also import the circle
? we also assign the perimeter, for the sake of animation later.

>the dashoffset makes the dasharray (the border of the circle) invsible.
