// we've been using the BROWSER to implement code, only
// e.g. we made a HTML file, linked it to a JS file, loaded them in the browser.

// for some projects, INSTEAD, we will run code directly on our machine, without a browser.
// let's compare js in the browser to js with node.

//MAIN DIFFERENCES
// 1A JS IN THE BROWSER
// to execute, we need to add <script> tags to the HTML doc
// AB JS WITH NODE
// instead we use the NODE CLI (command line interface) to run our code from our terminal

// 2A BROWSER
// we use the DOM, window, document.etc
// 2B NODE
// these don't exist in node or the CLI

// 3A BROWSER
// we can load lots of files and reference between them easily within the same window
// 3B NODE
// files cannot talk to each other.

// 4A BROWSER
// libraries are included using <script> tags, among other ways
//4 B NODE
// instead to use libraries, we use NPM (the NODE PACKAGE MANAGER)
